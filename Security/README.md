|In Progress    |[Injection Flaws](https://github.com/MichaelZaslavsky/study-summaries/tree/master/Security/Injection%20Flaws)          |Injection flaws are a security vulnerability that allows a user to gain access to the backend database, shell command, or operating system call if the web app takes user input. Hackers append additional information within these input boxes and can create, read, update, or delete data.
