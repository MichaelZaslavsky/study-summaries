|DONE           |[CRLF Injection](https://github.com/MichaelZaslavsky/study-summaries/tree/master/Security/Injection%20Flaws/CRLF%20Injection)      |CRLF Injection is **a software application coding vulnerability that occurs when an attacker injects a CRLF character sequence where it is not expected.** When CRLF injection is used to split an HTTP response header, it is referred to as HTTP Response Splitting.
|DONE           |[CSS Injection](https://github.com/MichaelZaslavsky/study-summaries/tree/master/Security/Injection%20Flaws/CRLF%20Injection)       |A CSS Injection vulnerability **involves the ability to inject arbitrary CSS code in the context of a trusted web site which is rendered inside a victim's browser**. The impact of this type of vulnerability varies based on the supplied CSS payload. It may lead to cross site scripting or data exfiltration.
|DONE           |[Code Injection](https://github.com/MichaelZaslavsky/study-summaries/tree/master/Security/Injection%20Flaws/Code%20Injection)      |Code Injection is **the exploitation of a computer bug that is caused by processing invalid data.** The injection is used by an attacker to introduce (or "inject") code into a vulnerable computer program and change the course of execution.
|DONE           |[Deserialization of Untrusted Data](https://github.com/MichaelZaslavsky/study-summaries/tree/master/Security/Injection%20Flaws/Deserialization%20of%20Untrusted%20Data)                                                                                                                                         |Deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502), is **when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid**, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.
|TODO           |Email Injection                                                                                                                    |
|DONE           |[LDAP Injection](https://github.com/MichaelZaslavsky/study-summaries/tree/master/Security/Injection%20Flaws/LDAP%20Injection)      |LDAP Injection is **an attack used to exploit web based applications that construct LDAP statements based on user input.** When an application fails to properly sanitize user input, it's possible to modify LDAP statements using a local proxy.
|TODO           |Local File Inclusion                                                                                                               |
|TODO           |Log Forging                                                                                                                        |
|DONE           |[NoSQL Injection](https://github.com/MichaelZaslavsky/study-summaries/tree/master/Security/Injection%20Flaws/NoSQL%20Injection)    |NoSQL injection **is a security weakness in a web application that uses a NoSQL database**. NoSQL (Not Only SQL) refers to database systems that use more flexible data formats and do not support Structured Query Language (SQL). They typically store and manage data as key-value pairs, documents, or data graphs.
|DONE           |[OS Command Injection](https://github.com/MichaelZaslavsky/study-summaries/tree/master/Security/Injection%20Flaws/OS%20Command%20Injection) |Command injection is a **cyber attack that involves executing arbitrary commands on a host operating system (OS)**. Typically, the threat actor injects the commands by exploiting an application vulnerability, such as insufficient input validation.
|DONE           |[Path Traversal](https://github.com/MichaelZaslavsky/study-summaries/tree/master/Security/Injection%20Flaws/Path%20Traversal)      |A path traversal attack exploits insufficient security validation or sanitization of user-supplied file names, such that characters representing "traverse to parent directory" are passed through to the operating system's file system API.
|TODO           |Remote File Inclusion                                                                                                              |
|TODO           |Resource Injection                                                                                                                 |
|DONE           |[SQL Injection](https://github.com/MichaelZaslavsky/study-summaries/tree/master/Security/Injection%20Flaws/SQL%20Injection)        |SQL Injection, also known as SQLI, is **a common attack vector that uses malicious SQL code for backend database manipulation to access information that was not intended to be displayed.** This information may include any number of items, including sensitive company data, user lists or private customer details.
|TODO           |XML Injection                                                                                                                      |

|TODO           |XQuery Injection                                                                                                                   |
