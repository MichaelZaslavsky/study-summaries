|DONE           |[SQL Injection](https://github.com/MichaelZaslavsky/study-summaries/tree/master/Security/Injection%20Flaws/SQL%20Injection)        |SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker).
|DONE           |[Code Injection](https://github.com/MichaelZaslavsky/study-summaries/tree/master/Security/Injection%20Flaws/Code%20Injection)      |Code injection is the term used to describe attacks that inject code into an application. That injected code is then interpreted by the application, changing the way a program executes. Code injection attacks typically exploit an application vulnerability that allows the processing of invalid data.
