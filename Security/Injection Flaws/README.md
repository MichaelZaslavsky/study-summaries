|DONE           |[SQL Injection](https://github.com/MichaelZaslavsky/study-summaries/tree/master/Security/Injection%20Flaws/SQL%20Injection)        |SQL injection, also known as SQLI, is **a common attack vector that uses malicious SQL code for backend database manipulation to access information that was not intended to be displayed.** This information may include any number of items, including sensitive company data, user lists or private customer details.
|DONE           |[Code Injection](https://github.com/MichaelZaslavsky/study-summaries/tree/master/Security/Injection%20Flaws/Code%20Injection)      |Code injection is **the exploitation of a computer bug that is caused by processing invalid data.** The injection is used by an attacker to introduce (or "inject") code into a vulnerable computer program and change the course of execution.
|DONE           |[CRLF Injection](https://github.com/MichaelZaslavsky/study-summaries/tree/master/Security/Injection%20Flaws/CRLF%20Injection)      |CRLF injection is **a software application coding vulnerability that occurs when an attacker injects a CRLF character sequence where it is not expected.** When CRLF injection is used to split an HTTP response header, it is referred to as HTTP Response Splitting.
|DONE           |[LDAP Injection](https://github.com/MichaelZaslavsky/study-summaries/tree/master/Security/Injection%20Flaws/LDAP%20Injection)      |LDAP Injection is **an attack used to exploit web based applications that construct LDAP statements based on user input.** When an application fails to properly sanitize user input, it's possible to modify LDAP statements using a local proxy.
|IN PROGRESS    |NoSQL Injection                                                                                                                    |
